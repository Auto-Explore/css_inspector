    .spacer {
        height: 100vh;
    }
    input {
        font-family: monospace;

        /* Use an explicit whole-number-of-pixels height, to avoid tripping
           Mozilla bug 1851066, regarding fractional scroll positions
           triggering an async 1px adjustment to scrollTop. We can remove this
           once that bug is fixed.
           (Without this hack, the input element may end up with a height
           that's a fractional number of pixels, depending on the font.
           And then this test's call to 'scrollIntoView' puts us at a
           fractional scroll-position, to bottom-align the input element. And
           that's sufficient to trigger bug 1851066 and get an asynchronous 1px
           adjustment to scrollTop, which this test doesn't expect.
