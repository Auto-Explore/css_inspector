.outer {
  /* This is just to make the percent values resolve to something
     predictable, and not browser-viewport-size-dependent. */
  width: 500px;
}

.abspos-cb {
  position: relative;
  height: 0;
  width: 0;

  /* This element's padding-box ends up 90px-by-90px, calculated as 9% of the
     .outer elements's 500px width (9% * 500px = 45px) on all four sides (top,
     left, right, and bottom). This padding-box serves as the containing block
     for the abspos flex container, and its size should be considered definite,
     since the percentage-based padding has a definite percentage basis to
     resolve against. So, all the percentage heights down the descendant-chain
     (all the way down to the canvas) should be considered definite as well, and
     that should contribute to canvas's intrinsic width contribution
     (transferring via its aspect-ratio) when the flex item resolves its
     'flex-basis:content'. */
