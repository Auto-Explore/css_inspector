    /* We use a gradient, which is part of the CSS 'image' type.
     * We set it up to create a hard diagonal edge from the bottom left to the
     * top right of #shape, which slices through each pixel along the diagonal.
     * Theoretically, this should place #too-wide at position 50,50 within
     * #shape's 100x100 region, but on some devices, the gradient rasterization
     * may leave pixel 50,49 unshaded enough that #too-wide is placed there
     * instead. To account for that possible off-by-one rounding scenario,
     * we set things up as follows:
     *  - We make #too-wide 1px taller than the corresponding content in the
     * reference case.
     *  - We clip the outermost div using a 'clip-path' that only paints
     * the region where the corresponding content is in the reference case.
     *  - If the testcase renders properly, then #too-wide will have 1px of
     * content clipped off of its top or bottom (depending on how the
     * linear-gradient rasterization and rounding works out). Either way,
     * it'll match the reference case.
