```css

span {
  outline: solid green 25px;
  outline-offset: -35px; /* Any value that makes sure the outlines collide ( < -25px )
                            would make the test valid,
                            -35px is just one such value that happens to make the failures pretty.
                            I recommend looking at this test in as many UAs as possible,
                            the results are quite astonishing.
