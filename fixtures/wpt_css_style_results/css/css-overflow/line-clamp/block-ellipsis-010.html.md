/* If a line box that has Ahem as its first available font, also has a glyph
 * from Gentium Plus, assuming no other relevant fonts and line-height: normal,
 * the line will be ~0.3em taller than it would be if it only had glyphs from
 * Ahem.
 *
 * Since we restrict the Unicode range of Ahem so it doesn't contain the
 * ellipsis or dot code points, the line-clamp ellipsis will need to be rendered
 * with Gentium Plus. But since the line-clamp ellipsis has line-height: 0, it
 * should not grow the height of the line box.
