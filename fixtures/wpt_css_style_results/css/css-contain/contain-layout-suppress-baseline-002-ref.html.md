    /* In the testcase, the (baseline-aligned) items should all have their
       bottom borders aligned with the 50px-tall canvas.  In other words, their
       bottom borders should all be aligned at the bottom of their flex
       container, separated from the bottom by only by their margin-end
       distance.  Here in the reference case, we just use "flex-end" alignment
       (plus the same amount of margin) to produce a precise reference for what
       that should look like. */
