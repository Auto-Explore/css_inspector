  div#table
    {
      display: table;
      font-family: monospace;
      font-size: 100px;
      table-layout: fixed;
      width: 4ch;
      contain: paint;
    }
  div.caption
    {
      display: table-caption;
      color: green;
      /* We have to limit the width of the caption here, or else the caption's
         intrinsic width (including the "FAIL" span) would "prop up" the width
         of the table to be a size that'd be larger than its specified width.
         Really, we want the table to be *only* 4 characters wide (as wide as
         the text "PASS"), with "FAIL" overflowing and getting clipped by
         "contain:paint" on the table wrapper box. */
      width: 4ch;

    {
      background-color: red;
